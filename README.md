### Linux Command Voodoo

One of the best pieces of advice I received at the start of my career was to create a file named command_voodoo.txt and use it to log various tips, tricks, syntax and other helpful items you discover during your journey.  Its a great resource for commands or syntax you use infrequently.  I've primarily used CentOS and Ubuntu distributions so syntax or command availability may vary.  Commands and syntax may vary between distrotions.  In this repository, I've posted some samples from my personal Command Voodoo file including:

* cron related
* complete deletions of files
* file manipulation
* image manipulation
* video manipulation

I have a separate repository for AWS CLI related entries from my Command Voodoo file.
